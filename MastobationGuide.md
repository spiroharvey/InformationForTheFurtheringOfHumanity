## or, A Quick 'n' Dirty How-to Guide for Using Mastodon

*Written by Spiro Harvey, @notawizard@mastodon.social.*

This is my guide. There are many others like it, but this one is mine.

I hope you find it useful. 

There's Big Help here: https://mastodon.help/

It's worth a read, but it's long. 


### 1. Find an instance

Unless you've got an invite from a friend, go to https://joinmastodon.org/

Note that the larger instances are getting hit hard because of the current (April 2022) influx of people, so if you can find one with fewer members, consider that.

You don't have to be on the same "instance" aka "server" as your friends. Federation means they all interconnect.

The go-to comparison is email. You can have an email account at GMail but still connect to people on Yahoo or Hotmail/Outlook, or AOL, or whatever.

The servers just talk to each other in the background and figure out how to connect to each other. It's magic.

### 2. Set up your profile

Fill out your profile as your first priority. A lot of people will not follow back if it's empty in case you're a bot.

### 3. Make an introduction

Make a post (a toot in Mastodon parlance) with the hashtag #introduction

This can be a quick blurb about you and who you're looking to connect with.

Include a list of hashtags. A lot of hashtags.

This is how people will find you.

### 3. Find some friends

Use those hashtags you just posted and look through existing posts. Find interesting people and Follow them.

### 4. Following someone via their @ address

You'll note that people share their @ address in a different format. Mine is:

  @notawizard@mastodon.social

And the reason for that double @ is because of the nature of the federated network. This tells you their name and the instance they are hosted on.

But that's not a URL so you can't enter it into your browser.

To add them, type that whole string into Mastodon's search bar at the top left:

Hit Search and you'll be able to see their profile.

### Cool, but what is it?

Mastodon is a microblogging service that's part of a global network of interconnected hosts. Mastodon is just one application, and it's completely free and open source so anyone can start their own instance and connect to the network.

The act of connecting to that global interconnected network is called federation or federating. The systems federate. However, it's a decentralised network, so there's no central governing body. 

We call this the **Fediverse**. 

In fact, you could create your own Mastodon instance and not even connect it to the greater federated network. Or create your own federation with just your friends.

There are many other applications that are part of the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), and they're not all microblogging. For example, Peertube is a video hosting service like Youtube, PixelFed is an image sharing platform like Instagram, WriteFreely is a full blogging service.

The thread that ties them all together is the [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub) protocol. If an application supports that, then you can connect to it and interact with its users from anywhere else in the Fediverse.

The beauty of the Fediverse is that you can follow accounts on all these other platforms, even if they use different software and functionality, all from your one account. You don't need to create an account on each and every system.

### How is this different to other social networks?

1. First off, freedom and control. You are not tied to one central company who owns it all and makes all the decisions on how it works and how you will be fed your information.

2. Mastodon and other applications on the Fediverse are open source, which means you are able to make a copy and modify it to suit you. But they do already offer a lot of customisation by default. A *lot* more than the corporate equivalents.

3. You're not being exploited as the product the platform is selling to their advertisers.

4. If you don't like the rules or the people on your instance, or you just find an instance with a name you like better, you can migrate your account and take all your posts and friends with you without losing them.

5. You can mute/block individuals or entire *instances* yourself. Let that sink in.
