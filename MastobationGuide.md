# Mastobation Guide

## or, A Quick 'n' Dirty How-to Guide for Using Mastodon

This is my guide. There are many others like it, but this one is mine.

I hope you find it useful. 

There's Big Help here: https://mastodon.help/
It's worth a read, but it's long. 


### Find an instance

Unless you've got an invite from a friend, go to https://joinmastodon.org/

Note that the larger instances are getting hit hard because of the current (April 2022) influx of people, so if you can find one with fewer members, consider that.

You don't have to be on the same "instance" aka "server" as your friends. Federation means they all interconnect.

The go-to comparison is email. You can have an email account at GMail but still connect to people on Yahoo or Hotmail/Outlook, or AOL, or whatever.

The servers just talk to each other in the background and figure out how to connect to each other. It's magic.

### Set up your profile

Fill out your profile as your first priority. A lot of people will not follow back if it's empty in case you're a bot.

### Make an introduction

Make a post (a toot in Mastodon parlance) with the hashtag #introduction

This can be a quick blurb about you and who you're looking to connect with.

Include a list of hashtags. A lot of hashtags.

This is how people will find you.

### Find some friends

Use those hashtags you just posted and look through existing posts. Find interesting people and Follow them.
